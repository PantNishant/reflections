Q) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans) When multiple people are working on a same project specially long distance or on
     has to work from different workstations.

Q) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
     automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans) Many people might be adding changes continuously to the remote, so pulling every change 
        which might not concern me at that time would be unnecessary and also would make the 
        local repository messy.
