Q) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans) .git file in created after initializing a repository and all the history of the file
        starts getting tracked. This needs to be done so that any  changes we make
        can be tracked and checked back to in case of an error.

Q) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
     What value do you thing it offers?
Ans.) Files in Staging area are not commited and files in the repository are commited.
         Files in Staging area are bundled together and added to the repository with a single 
         commit while file in the working directory can not be commited directly to the 
         repository.
